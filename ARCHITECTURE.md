# Bark — Multi-User Web Coding Agent

## Overview

Bark is a multi-user web app that gives each user their own isolated Pi coding agent (pi.dev) running in a Docker container. Users authenticate with a simple login, can create multiple named workspaces, and interact with Pi through a split-pane UI with a chat interface, file viewer, and debug panel.

```

### Components

- **Backend** (`src/backend/`): Python/FastAPI — single-port server for API, WebSocket, and frontend static files
- **Frontend** (`src/frontend/`): Flutter Web — chat with markdown rendering, syntax-highlighted code blocks, file viewer, debug panel
- **Docker** (`src/dockerimage/`): Custom Dockerfile for Pi agent containers with Python3, Node.js, build-essential, SQLite, vim, emacs, network tools, Pi extensions

### Key Technologies

- **AG-UI Protocol**: Standardized agent-user interaction protocol for event streaming
- **Pi Coding Agent**: Minimal terminal coding harness (pi.dev) running in RPC mode with native session persistence and extension tools
- **Ollama**: LLM provider — supports both Ollama Cloud and self-hosted instances, configurable via env vars (`OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_API_KEY`)
- **Pydantic Logfire**: AI observability — FastAPI auto-instrumentation via Logfire Python SDK (`LOGFIRE_TOKEN`), Pi agent tracing via [pi-otel-telemetry](https://github.com/mprokopov/pi-otel-telemetry) extension (OTLP export to Logfire). Both trace sources appear in the same Logfire project. Container OTEL env vars (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`) are auto-constructed from `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`/`LOGFIRE_BASE_URL` when set.
- **devenv**: Nix-based development environment with auto-setup, conditional build tasks (`execIfModified`), auto-reload disabled

## Features

### Authentication

- Email/password with bcrypt hashing, email validated at registration
- Email verification: registration sends a verification email with a signed token link; user must click to activate account and is auto-logged-in on verification. Resend via "Resend verification email" link on login page (shown on 403 "not verified" error, rate-limited to 1/min per email)
- Email sent via SMTP (`BARK_SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASSWORD/FROM`) or local sendmail (default, configurable via `BARK_SENDMAIL_PATH`)
- JWT tokens (24hr expiry, secret configurable via BARK_JWT_SECRET) with token blocklist for logout, roles claim in JWT payload
- Role-based access control: `roles` and `user_roles` tables, `require_role()` FastAPI dependency for endpoint protection
- Default user auto-seeded on startup with admin role (configurable via BARK_DEFAULT_USER/PASSWORD in .env)
- Admin user management: list/add/edit/delete users, toggle roles, user data archived to tar.xz on deletion, self-deletion prevented
- Open registration with email verification (test mode auto-verifies for E2E tests)
- Login rejects unverified accounts
- Session persists across page reloads (async token loading before routing)
- Deep link preservation: unauthenticated visits to protected URLs redirect to login, then return to the original URL after successful login

### Workspaces

- Multiple workspaces per user
- Each workspace gets its own Docker container + bind-mounted directory
- URL-based workspace routing (survives page reload via hash URL reading)
- Deep link preservation: unauthenticated visits to protected URLs redirect to login with a `?redirect=` param, then return to the original URL after successful login
- Workspace name and logged-in user email shown in app bar, browser tab title
- Containers stop when navigating away (browser back, in-app back, logout)
- Containers auto-restart transparently when user sends next prompt
- Container lifecycle visible in debug panel

### Pi Agent Integration

- One Docker container per workspace running Pi in RPC mode
- Container communicates via stdin/stdout JSON-RPC (docker attach subprocess)
- Pi RPC events translated to AG-UI events in real-time
- Native Pi session persistence (JSONL files in workspace `.pi/sessions/`)
- Session resume on reconnect via `--session` CLI flag (passed as `BARK_RESUME_SESSION` env var to the container; avoids `switch_session` RPC which would re-read the FIFO)
- Per-workspace port allocation: well-known container ports (8000+) mapped to host ports (9000+), persisted in SQLite (`port_allocations` table with per-port PRIMARY KEY preventing overlap). Ports allocated at workspace creation, stable across restarts, freed by CASCADE on workspace delete. `num_ports` column on workspaces table (default 5) controls how many; on container start, ports are added/removed to match. `BARK_PORT_MAPPINGS` env var passes container:host pairs to the container.
- Built-in `get_hosted_url` tool converts container port to full user-facing URL using `BARK_PORT_MAPPINGS`, `BARK_HOSTING_HOSTNAME`, `BARK_HOSTING_PROTO`, and `BARK_HOSTING_BASE_PATH`
- Hosted app proxy: user apps are accessible at `{base_path}/hosted/{workspace_id}/{port}/` — nginx proxies requests directly to `localhost:{port}` on the host (bypassing the Python backend). No authentication required for hosted app URLs.
- LLM provider/model configured via `settings.json` FIFO (sets `defaultProvider` and `defaultModel`)
- API key delivered via `models.json` FIFO (named pipe, written once at startup, deleted after Pi reads it — key never persists on disk)
- Both config FIFOs written by a `nohup` background process that survives the `exec` to Pi — settings.json is written first (Pi's SettingsManager reads it), then models.json (Pi's ModelRegistry reads it)
- All provider env vars (`OLLAMA_*`, `ANTHROPIC_*`, etc.) stripped from Pi's process environment before exec
- `/bin/sh` symlinked to `/bin/bash` in the base image so Pi's bash tool supports bashisms (`source`, etc.)
- System prompt (`src/dockerimage/system-prompt.md`) copied into image at build time. Instructs the agent to: create virtualenvs for Python projects, run `npm init` for Node projects, background long-running servers, always use `get_hosted_url` for fresh URLs, show full URLs as link text, and warn users that container restarts kill running processes
- 30-minute idle timeout (configurable via `BARK_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) with automatic container stop, debug notification, and terminal overlay with restart button. Activity is recorded on user actions (prompt, steer, terminal input) and on every Pi event (tool calls, text streaming), so containers stay alive during long-running LLM requests as long as events are flowing. Stuck tool executions (e.g., foreground server) produce no events and will eventually time out.
- All user containers stopped on logout and backend shutdown
- Read-only root filesystem (`ReadonlyRootfs: True`) — the agent cannot modify system files or install packages outside the workspace. Writable paths:
  - `/work` — bind mount to host (user files, `$BARK_DATA_DIR/workspaces/<user>/work/<workspace>/`)
  - `/home/bark` — bind mount to host (persistent home, `$BARK_DATA_DIR/workspaces/<user>/home/<workspace>/`). Dotfiles (`.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, `.gitconfig`), bash history, and Pi sessions persist across container restarts. Pi agent config (`.pi/agent/`) is cleaned and regenerated each start.
  - `/tmp` — tmpfs (scratch space)
  - `/run`, `/var/log` — tmpfs (runtime)
- `bark` user baked into the image at build time with the host UID/GID (passed as Docker build args)
- Root escalation prevented: root password locked, suid removed from `su`/`chsh`/`chfn`/`newgrp`
- Containers labeled with `bark.managed=true`, `bark.instance=<BARK_INSTANCE_ID>`, and `bark.workspace-id=<id>` for identification, cleanup, and orphan detection (not reliant on image name). Multiple Bark instances on the same host use different `BARK_INSTANCE_ID` values to isolate their containers.
- `Init: True` (Docker `--init`) runs `tini` as PID 1 to reap zombie processes from terminal sessions and tool executions

### Container Terminal

- Direct shell access to the workspace container via the Terminal tab in the right panel
- Uses xterm.dart (pure Flutter terminal emulator) with a dark theme (Tomorrow Night palette)
- Backend spawns `docker exec` subprocess with PTY (`os.openpty`) piped over the existing WebSocket
- Runs as `bark` user in `/work` with bash, tab completion, readline, colored prompt/ls, and persistent history (defaults from `/etc/bash.bashrc` in the image, overridable via `~/.bashrc` on the persistent home mount). History is flushed to `~/.bash_history` after each command via `PROMPT_COMMAND` so it survives terminal kills.
- Terminal interaction bumps the container idle timeout via `record_activity()`
- On-demand: subprocess starts when user clicks the Terminal tab
- State preserved across tab switches (IndexedStack keeps all panels alive)
- Right-click context menu with Copy (when text selected) and Paste
- Scrollbar for terminal history
- Overlay with restart button when container stops (idle timeout or unexpected), auto-reconnects terminal session after restart
- Cleaned up on workspace disconnect or WebSocket close

### Right Panel Layout

- Two-part split: tabbed panel on top (Terminal, Files tabs) and slidable Debug panel on bottom
- Debug panel collapsed by default, expandable via draggable horizontal divider
- All panels stay alive across switches (IndexedStack for tabs, always-mounted Debug)
- Debug pane receives events from the start, even before first viewed

### Pi Extensions (Tools)

- Extensions are TypeScript files collected from `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/*/extension.ts` and staged at `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/.docker/extensions/` at build time (injected via named Docker build contexts)
- The LLM sees them in its tool list alongside built-in tools (read, write, edit, bash)
- Extensions can be server-side (run code inside the container) or client-side (delegate to the browser via the Extension UI Sub-Protocol)
- AGENTS.md is generated dynamically on each container start, listing all registered extension tools
- Sample plugins exist in `plugins/`:
  - `word_count` — fast file stats (lines, words, characters, size) via Python script (server-side)
  - `pig_latin` — text to Pig Latin converter, pure TypeScript (server-side)
  - `celebrate` — triggers confetti animation in the browser (client-side, via Extension UI Sub-Protocol)
  - `beep` — plays an audible beep tone via Web Audio API (client-side, via Extension UI Sub-Protocol)

### Chat Interface

- Markdown rendering for assistant responses (flutter_markdown_plus)
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks (Monokai Sublime theme, highlight.dart, JetBrains Mono)
- Collapsible tool call cards showing arguments and results
- Streaming indicator while agent is thinking
- Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline
- Abort button (red when agent running)
- Conversation history persisted to SQLite and restored on workspace reload
- Input history navigation (up/down arrow keys cycle through previous prompts)
- Queued messages shown dimmed with "queued" label, persisted in SQLite
- Persistent error snackbars with close button
- Text is selectable and copyable via native right-click
- Clickable URLs open in a new browser tab, with a copy button next to each link
- Bare URLs in assistant messages are auto-linked (converted to clickable markdown links)

### File Viewer

- Directory tree with file sizes
- Click to view file contents (16pt JetBrains Mono, left-aligned)
- Auto-refresh when Pi writes/edits files or runs file-creating/deleting bash commands
- Auto-refresh when switching to the Files tab (refreshes in-place, preserving current directory)
- Drag-and-drop upload for files and folders (preserves directory structure, progress indicator)
- Uploads go into the currently viewed directory (not always root)
- Duplicate detection: blocks upload if a file or folder with the same name already exists
- Right-click context menu on files and folders: Download, Rename (with dialog), and Delete (with confirmation)
- Download files directly; download folders as .zip (zipped on the fly by the backend)
- Path bar with ellipsis overflow, clickable `/` root link, and up-arrow navigation button
- nginx `client_max_body_size 500m` for large file uploads
- nginx `sub_filter` rewrites `<base href>` for subpath hosting (`/bark/`)

### Debug Panel

- Container lifecycle events (starting, ready with port info and status, idle stop, restart)
- Session resume notifications
- Query text shown for each prompt sent
- Tool call entries from Pi (including extension tools)
- Error entries
- Timestamps and color-coded entries
- Selectable text for titles and content
- Clear button

### UI/Theme

- Harvest-inspired light theme (warm off-white, green accents, medium gray header)
- Orange Bark logo (paw icon + "Bark" text)
- 3D edges on all dividers, panel headers, and borders
- Two-column layout: chat (left, 38%) and right panel (62%) with resizable vertical divider
- Right panel: Terminal+Files tabs on top, slidable Debug panel on bottom (collapsed by default)
- All panels kept alive via IndexedStack (tabs) and always-mounted Debug
- Dark blue back/logout buttons
- Browser tab title updates per page ("Bark - Login", "Bark - Workspaces", "Bark - workspace-name")

### Hosting

- **nginx is the primary access point** (port 8995 locally). It proxies API/WebSocket to uvicorn and proxies hosted app URLs directly to container ports (no Python in the hosted app path).
- FastAPI serves API endpoints and Flutter frontend static files on port 8997 (not accessed directly by users).
- Hosted app URLs (`/hosted/{workspace_id}/{port}/`) are handled by an nginx regex location that extracts the port and proxies to `127.0.0.1:{port}`.
- Subpath hosting (e.g., `/bark/` on arctor) handled by an outer nginx that sends `X-Forwarded-Prefix`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers. Bark's `_derive_hosting_info` uses these to generate correct hosted app URLs. The outer nginx also rewrites `<base href>` via `sub_filter`.
- Frontend derives API URLs from `<base href>` — works on both root and subpath.
- WebSocket proxying via nginx `proxyWebsockets`.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Nix with devenv installed (run `./bootstrap` to install both)
- Docker daemon running
- Ollama — either a Cloud account with API key, or a self-hosted instance

### Setup & Run

```bash
# Create .env
cat > .env << 'EOF'
OLLAMA_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://ollama.com/v1       # or http://localhost:11434/v1 for self-hosted
OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma4:31b                     # any model available on your Ollama instance
BARK_JWT_SECRET=change-this-to-a-random-secret
BARK_DEFAULT_USER=admin@example.com
# BARK_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=admin  # omit to generate a random password on first run
EOF

# Install Nix and devenv (if not already installed)
./bootstrap

# Start the app (foreground with TUI)
devenv processes up

# Or start in background (no TUI)
devenv processes up -d

# Disable TUI globally (useful for scripting/CI)
export DEVENV_TUI=0

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8995
```

### Environment Variables

All settings can be overridden in `.env`. Defaults (where appropriate) are provided in `devenv.nix` at low priority so `.env` values take precedence.

**`file:` prefix:** Any env var can be prefixed with `file:` to read the value from a file at runtime (e.g. `BARK_JWT_SECRET=file:/run/secrets/jwt`). The file contents are stripped of leading/trailing whitespace. This works with secret management tools like agenix/sops that write decrypted secrets to files. If the file cannot be read, an error is logged and the value is treated as unset.

### Ports

- `BARK_NGINX_PORT` (default `8995`): **Primary access point** — nginx serves UI, API, WebSocket, and proxies hosted app URLs directly to container ports
- `BARK_PORT` (default `8997`): Backend (FastAPI/uvicorn)
- `9000+`: User app ports (5 per workspace)

### Rebuild

To force rebuild the Docker image and Flutter web app:

```bash
devenv shell -- rebuild
```

The `dockerbuild` and `flutterbuildweb` commands run the corresponding devenv tasks (`bark:docker-build`, `bark:flutter-build`) with `--refresh-task-cache` to force a rebuild regardless of `execIfModified` state. The `rebuild` command runs both. The `pull-base-image` command pulls the latest base image from GHCR (run this after CI rebuilds the base image).

On normal startup, Flutter and Docker builds run automatically when their source files have changed (via devenv `execIfModified` content hashing). Watched paths:

- **Flutter**: `src/frontend/lib/**`, `src/frontend/web/**`, `src/frontend/pubspec.yaml`, `src/frontend/pubspec.lock`, `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/**/*.dart`, `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/plugins.lock`
- **Docker**: `src/dockerimage/**`, `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/**/*.ts`, `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/**/tools/**`, `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/plugins.lock`

### Testing

**Unit tests** (backend, no Docker required):

```bash
# Run all backend tests (devenv script)
devenv shell -- test-backend

# Or directly with pytest
devenv shell -- python -m pytest src/backend/tests -v

# Run a single test file
devenv shell -- test-backend src/backend/tests/test_auth.py

# Run a single test by name
devenv shell -- test-backend -k 'test_login_success'
```

100% line coverage across all backend modules. Tests use real SQLite databases in pytest temp directories (no mocking of the database layer). Docker and subprocess interactions are mocked. Each test gets its own isolated temp directory — multiple test processes can run in parallel without conflicts. Coverage report is printed automatically.

**E2E tests** (Playwright, Chromium + Firefox + WebKit):

```bash
# Run all tests (devenv script — installs npm deps, runs each browser sequentially)
devenv shell -- test-e2e

# Run a single test by name
devenv shell -- test-e2e -g 'navigate to workspace'

# Run with headed browser (visible) — useful for debugging coordinate-based clicks
devenv shell -- test-e2e --headed

# Run with verbose output
devenv shell -- test-e2e --reporter=list
```

E2E tests run against Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit using browsers from `pkgs.playwright-driver.browsers` (NixOS-patched, no manual browser install needed). The `@playwright/test` npm version must match `pkgs.playwright-driver.version` exactly (currently 1.59.1). Browsers run sequentially (one at a time) to avoid memory pressure from multiple browser engines — within each browser, tests run in parallel with one worker per CPU core (default `100%`; override with `BARK_E2E_WORKERS=N`). Global test timeout is 300s. Each test registers its own unique user and creates its own workspace, so tests are fully isolated.

The test server spawns the bark server on a non-default port (18997) with a temp `BARK_DATA_DIR` so it doesn't conflict with a running dev server. Flutter Web renders to canvas, so UI interaction uses coordinate-based clicks on `<flutter-view>`. LLM-dependent tests require `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, and `OLLAMA_MODEL` in `.env` or the process environment.

**Frontend unit tests** (Dart/Flutter, no browser required):

```bash
# Run all frontend tests (devenv script)
devenv shell -- test-frontend

# Run a single test file
devenv shell -- test-frontend test/agui_events_test.dart
```

Tests cover agui events, agui client, auth service, chat panel, container terminal, file upload (conflict detection, upload paths, auth headers, error handling, directory flattening), file viewer panel (navigation, breadcrumbs, refresh), IDE layout (tabs, dividers, IndexedStack), login page, output panel, tool plugin registry, workspace list page (CRUD dialogs, loading/error states), and bark logo. Every test has at least one assertion. Browser-only APIs (`dart:html`, `dart:js_interop`) are abstracted via conditional imports (`web_helpers_stub.dart`/`web_helpers_web.dart`) so tests run in VM mode without a browser.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on `git commit` via [git-hooks.nix](https://github.com/cachix/git-hooks.nix):

- **ruff check --fix** — Python linting with auto-fix
- **ruff format** — Python formatting
- **dart format** — Dart formatting
- **nixfmt** — Nix formatting
- **prettier** — TypeScript, JavaScript, and YAML formatting
- **yamllint** — YAML linting

Hooks are installed automatically when entering the devenv shell.

### CI

GitHub Actions run automatically on PRs and pushes to main (all also support `workflow_dispatch` for manual triggering):

- **Backend tests** (`.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml`) — triggered by changes to `src/backend/` or `pytest.ini`
- **Frontend tests** (`.github/workflows/frontend-tests.yml`) — triggered by changes to `src/frontend/lib/`, `src/frontend/test/`, or `src/frontend/pubspec.yaml`. Uses `stub_dart_plugins.sh` to create a minimal `bark_plugins` package so `flutter pub get` works without the full plugin codegen.
- **E2E tests** (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`) — runs hourly via cron (skips if no commits in the last hour) and on manual `workflow_dispatch`. Requires `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, and `OLLAMA_MODEL` secrets. Runs Playwright against Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit sequentially (browsers from `playwright-driver.browsers` in nixpkgs, one worker per CPU core). Warms up Ollama before each browser run. Uploads test results and per-run backend logs as artifacts on failure.

### Plugin System

All plugins live in `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/<name>/` directories. A plugin can contain:

- `extension.ts` — Pi extension with `pi.registerTool()`. Copied to `src/dockerimage/extensions/` at build time.
- `dart/` — Optional Dart package for client-side tools:
  - `dart/pubspec.yaml` — Package definition, depends on `bark_plugin_api` (git)
  - `dart/lib/plugin.dart` — Class extending `ToolPlugin` with action handlers
  - `dart/lib/*.dart` — Supporting Dart files (widgets, utilities)
- `tools/` — Server-side scripts. Everything in this subdirectory is copied to `/opt/bark/plugin-tools/<name>/` in the Docker image.

A plugin needs at minimum an `extension.ts`. The `dart/` subdirectory is only needed for client-side tools that delegate execution to the browser via `ctx.ui.input("HOST_TOOL_REQUEST", ...)`.

**Build integration:**

- `scripts/import_dart_plugins.py` scans `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/*/dart/` for plugin Dart packages and generates `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/.dart/` (the `bark_plugins` package with path deps and `createAllPlugins()`)
- `dockerbuild` stages `extension.ts` and `tools/` files from all plugins into `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/.docker/` and passes them via named Docker build contexts (`plugin-extensions`, `plugin-tools`)
- `flutterbuildweb` runs the codegen before compiling
- `stub_dart_plugins.sh` creates a minimal stub at `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/.dart/` so `flutter pub get` works before plugins are fetched (runs automatically at devenv shell startup via `enterShell`; skips if `pubspec_overrides.yaml` already exists)
- Both build tasks are triggered automatically by `devenv up` via `execIfModified`

**Adding a plugin:**

For local development, create files directly in `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR`:

1. Create `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/<name>/extension.ts` with `pi.registerTool()`
2. For client-side tools, add `dart/pubspec.yaml` (depends on `bark_plugin_api`) and `dart/lib/plugin.dart` extending `ToolPlugin`
3. For server-side scripts, add files in `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/<name>/tools/`
4. `devenv up` rebuilds automatically when `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR` changes

For remote plugins, add an entry to `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/plugins.yaml` and run `update-plugins` to fetch it. See **Plugin management** below.

**Plugin management:**

Plugins are declared in `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR/plugins.yaml`. Each entry requires `name` and `git`; `path` and `ref` are optional:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: celebrate
    git: git@github.com:mcdonc/bark.git
    path: plugins/celebrate
    ref: main
  - name: beep
    git: git@github.com:mcdonc/bark.git
    path: plugins/beep
    ref: main
  - name: pig-latin
    git: git@github.com:mcdonc/bark.git
    path: plugins/pig-latin
    ref: main
  - name: word-count
    git: git@github.com:mcdonc/bark.git
    path: plugins/word-count
    ref: main
```

- `scripts/update_plugins.py` — Python script that manages plugin fetching:
  - If `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR` doesn't exist, creates it with a template `plugins.yaml` that includes sample plugins (celebrate, beep, pig-latin, word-count)
  - If `plugins.yaml` exists, fetches listed plugins, resolves git refs to commit SHAs, and writes `plugins.lock`
  - On full update, removes fetched plugin directories that are no longer listed in `plugins.yaml` (local-only plugins not in the lockfile are left alone)
- `update-plugins` — devenv script alias that runs `python3 scripts/update_plugins.py "$@"`
- `update-plugins <name>` — fetch/update a single plugin by name, preserving other lock entries
- `plugins/` — directory in the Bark repo containing starter plugin source. These aren't special — they're just plugins that happen to live in the same repo and are referenced in the generated template.
- `plugins.lock` — records resolved commit SHAs for reproducible builds
- On first `devenv up`, if `plugins.yaml` exists but no lockfile is found, `update-plugins` runs automatically. After that, updates are explicit only.
- Local plugin development: drop a directory into `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR` directly — the build system treats it the same as a fetched plugin.
- `execIfModified` watches `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR` to trigger rebuilds when plugin content or the lockfile changes.
- Since `$BARK_PLUGINS_DIR` is outside the repo, there are no `.gitignore` conflicts with devenv's `execIfModified`.

### Data

- All data stored in `$BARK_DATA_DIR` (defaults to `~/.bark/data`)
- SQLite database: `bark.db` (users, workspaces, messages, token blocklist)
- Workspace files: `workspaces/<user-id>/work/<workspace-id>/` (mounted as `/work`)
- Persistent home: `workspaces/<user-id>/home/<workspace-id>/` (mounted as `/home/bark` — dotfiles, bash history, Pi sessions)
- Database persists across restarts and rebuilds

## Client-Side Tool Delegation via Extension UI Sub-Protocol

We use Pi's **Extension UI Sub-Protocol** to delegate tool execution to the browser.

### How it works

Pi extensions can call `ctx.ui.input(title, placeholder)` from within a tool's `execute` method. In RPC mode, this emits an `extension_ui_request` event on stdout and blocks until an `extension_ui_response` comes back on stdin. We use this as a general-purpose request/response channel between the container and the browser.

**Convention**: Extensions use `ctx.ui.input("HOST_TOOL_REQUEST", jsonPayload)` where the payload encodes the action to perform. The frontend parses the JSON, executes the action, and sends the result back.

### Flow

```text
LLM calls tool → Pi extension execute()
  → ctx.ui.input("HOST_TOOL_REQUEST", '{"action":"...", ...}')
  → Pi emits: {"type":"extension_ui_request","id":"...","method":"input","title":"HOST_TOOL_REQUEST","placeholder":"..."}
  → Backend forwards to frontend via WebSocket
  → Frontend executes action (browser-side, with auth cookies)
  → Frontend sends: {"cmd":"extension_ui_response","id":"...","value":"result"}
  → Backend forwards to Pi stdin
  → Extension receives result, returns to LLM
```

### Current client-side tools

- **celebrate** (`plugins/celebrate/`): Triggers confetti animation in the browser
- **beep** (`plugins/beep/`): Plays a beep sound in the browser

### Soliplex integration

Soliplex has its own Bark plugins currently hosted on the `bark-integration` branch of the Soliplex repository within `bark-plugin`.

The Soliplex tools run entirely in the browser, which has the user's Soliplex authentication cookies. When deployed behind nginx on the same domain, the browser can call Soliplex APIs directly with no CORS issues. Set `SOLIPLEX_URL` in `.env` to tell the frontend where Soliplex is (served via the `/api/config` endpoint). Leave it empty when Bark and Soliplex share the same origin (the typical nginx setup). Cross-origin setups require CORS configuration on the Soliplex side.

The query flow: frontend creates a thread in the Soliplex room, posts the user's question as an AG-UI `RunAgentInput`, collects the streamed SSE response, extracts `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas, and returns the assembled text to the Pi extension.

- **soliplex_list_rooms** (external, via `plugins.yaml`): Lists available Soliplex knowledge base rooms
- **soliplex_query** (external, via `plugins.yaml`): Queries a Soliplex room via AG-UI (creates thread, posts question, collects SSE response). Default room: `search`

The devenv.nix runs nginx as the primary access point:

```text
nginx reverse proxy (port 8995)
    ├── /hosted/{ws_id}/{port}/ → container port (direct proxy)
    └── /                       → Bark backend (port 8997)
```

On arctor (production), the external nginx handles the `/bark/` subpath:

```text
arctor nginx (443)
    ├── /bark/hosted/{ws_id}/{port}/ → container port (direct proxy)
    └── /bark/                       → bark nginx (port 8995)
                                         └── / → uvicorn (port 8997)
```
