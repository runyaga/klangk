"""Inline `sourcesContent` into Flutter web source maps.

dart2wasm and dart2js emit source maps whose `sources` array uses
`org-dartlang-sdk:///` (Dart SDK / engine sources) and `file:///` (nix-store
Flutter framework) URIs that browsers can't fetch. Without `sourcesContent`,
Firefox/Chrome devtools fail to resolve those frames and you get a wall of
"unsupported protocol for sourcemap request" errors.

This rewrites the .map files to embed the actual source text inline. After
this runs, devtools resolve traces with no network fetches.

Usage:
    inline_sources_in_map.py <flutter-sdk> <map-file> [<map-file> ...]
